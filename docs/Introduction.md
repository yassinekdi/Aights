# Introduction

Welcome to **AIghts: The Ultimate Crazy Eights Challenge**!

## Project Goals

- **Multiplayer Game**: Create a multiplayer environment where players can compete against each other in the classic card game Crazy Eights. Each game should include at least one RL agent to challenge players and enhance the gameplay experience.

- **RL Enthusiasts**: Provide a platform for reinforcement learning (RL) enthusiasts to follow, build, and improve AI agents using various RL techniques. Users can experiment with different strategies and see how their agents perform in real-time games.

- **Open Source Contribution**: This is an open-source project that invites contributors to participate in different aspects of development:
  1. **Project Development**: Contribute to backend, frontend, and MLOps development to improve the game's infrastructure and user experience.
  2. **RL Agents**: Develop and push your own RL agents once trained. Share your agents with the community and see how they perform against others.

Join us in creating a dynamic and fun gaming experience that combines classic card gameplay with cutting-edge AI technology!
