**React** paired with **TypeScript** is chosen for developing our Texas Hold'em poker application due to several advantages. React's component-based architecture facilitates the management of user interfaces required in interactive gaming, enabling dynamic updates and responsive gameplay. The use of TypeScript enhances this setup by adding strong typing, which significantly reduces bugs and improves the maintainability of the code. Additionally, both React and TypeScript are popularly used in game development, further supporting their reliability and effectiveness for creating sophisticated gaming experiences.

For the model-serving runtime, the selection criteria are critical to ensuring optimal performance and integration:
1. **Performance**: The runtime must offer low latency and high throughput capabilities.
2. **Ease of Integration**: Seamless compatibility with PyTorch is essential as it is our primary machine learning framework.
3. **Monitoring and Logging**: The runtime should support extensive monitoring and logging capabilities, including Prometheus integration for tracking model performance and debugging. It should also allow customization to incorporate specific machine learning metrics and logs.
4. **Parallel Processing**: Ability to handle multiple inference requests simultaneously is necessary for efficient scaling.
5. **Asynchronous APIs**: Support for asynchronous operations is crucial to enhance throughput and responsiveness.

These requirements align with the non-functional requirements outlined in [Project requirements](docs/Project_Requirements.md). Given these requirements, TorchServe is identified as the most suitable option. It is specifically tailored for PyTorch, providing robust support for parallel processing and asynchronous APIs, which enhances our application's responsiveness and scalability. TorchServe's integration with Prometheus for detailed monitoring and the ability to customize logging further aligns with our needs for comprehensive operational insights.

## Backend (Django)
The choice to utilize **Python** for the backend of our Texas Hold'em poker application is grounded in its widespread use and my personal proficiency with the language. **Django**, a powerful and well-known Python framework, is particularly suited for this project due to its robust features for building scalable web applications. Django's capability to handle both traditional server-side requests and real-time WebSockets via **Django Channels** makes it an ideal choice for a multiplayer gaming environment. This combination ensures a flexible, reliable backend architecture that can efficiently manage game logic, player interactions, and real-time data communication.
