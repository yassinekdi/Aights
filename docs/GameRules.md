# Crazy Eights

## Objective
Be the first player to get rid of all your cards or have the fewest cards when the game ends.

## Setup
1. **Deck**: Use a standard 52-card deck.
2. **Players**: 2 to 5 players.
3. **Dealing**: Each player is dealt 3-5 cards. The remaining cards form the draw pile, and the top card is placed face up to start the discard pile.

## Gameplay
1. **Starting**: The player to the left of the dealer starts.
2. **Playing a Card**: On your turn, play one card from your hand that matches the rank or suit of the top card on the discard pile. Place it on the discard pile.
3. **Drawing a Card**: If you cannot play a card, draw one card from the draw pile. If you can play this card, do so immediately. If not, keep it and your turn ends.
4. **Turn Time Limit**: Each player has a fixed time limit (e.g., 15 seconds) to play their turn.
5. **Special Cards**:
   - **Eights (8s)**: An eight can be played on any card, and the player must declare the suit that the next player must play.
   - **Twos (2s)**: The next player must draw two cards and lose their turn.
   - **Jacks (J)**: The next player loses their turn.
   - **Aces (A)**: The direction of play reverses.

## Game End
- The game ends when a player plays all their cards or when the fixed game time (e.g., 10 minutes) is reached.
- If the game time ends, the player with the fewest cards remaining wins.

## Scoring (optional)
If playing multiple rounds, keep score by adding up the values of the cards left in opponents' hands:
- Number cards (2-10): Face value
- Jacks (J), Queens (Q), Kings (K): 10 points each
- Aces (A): 1 point
- Eights (8): 50 points

The player with the lowest total score after a set number of rounds wins.
